Welcome to my Wordle Game in SPA!
Are you a Wordle fan? Well, I am! That's why I decided to create a brand new Wordle gaming experience, right in a Single Page Application (SPA). This is an exciting opportunity to test my programming skills while diving deeper into the world of game development.

Why this game is special:
Immersive experience: Enjoy the familiar fun of Wordle in a modern, responsive web environment.
Challenge yourself: Test your word-guessing skills as you race against the clock and work to uncover the secret word.
Customization: Tailor the game difficulty to your preferences and skill level.

How to Play:
Enter your five-letter word and see how many letters are correct and if they are in the correct position.
Visual Feedback: Letters will be highlighted according to your accuracy:
Red: If the letter is not in the correct word.
Yellow: If the letter is in the correct word but in the wrong position.
Green: If the letter is in the correct position and in the correct word.
Based on the feedback, refine your guesses until you discover the correct word!
Have fun sharing your scores and challenging your friends to see who's the Wordle master!

Technologies Used:
JavaScript ES6: We utilized the power of JavaScript ES6 to create efficient and modern game logic.
HTML: The basic structure of the game was built with HTML to create a solid foundation for the user interface.
CSS: We used CSS to style and bring the game to life, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive experience.
SPA (Single Page Application): This game is a Single Page Application, meaning you can navigate and enjoy all the game's functionality without needing to reload the page, providing a smooth and uninterrupted experience.
jQuery: jQuery was used to simplify the process of DOM manipulation and interaction with page elements, making development more efficient.
DOM (Document Object Model): We used the DOM to dynamically interact with HTML elements and update the user interface based on player actions.
MVC (Model-View-Controller): We adopted the MVC pattern to organize the code in a clear and modular way, separating the business logic (Model), presentation (View), and control (Controller), facilitating maintenance and extension of the game.
